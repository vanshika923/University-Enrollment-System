# University Enrollment System

## Project Description
The University Enrollment System is a Java-based console application designed to model a real-world course enrollment process using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles. The system manages students, professors, and courses, and ensures controlled enrollment through custom exception handling when course capacity limits are exceeded.

## Key Features
- Object-oriented design using classes and objects
- Encapsulation for secure data handling
- Polymorphism through method overriding
- Aggregation between courses, professors, and students
- Custom exception handling for enrollment limits

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- Exception Handling

## Execution
Run the Main.java file to execute the application and view the output in the console.
